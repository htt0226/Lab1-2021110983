To explore strange new worlds,
To seek out new life and new civilizations?
The sun shone brightly over the ocean, where waves gently kissed the shore.
The rays created a golden path on the water.
The ocean waves dance, mirror the glow and explore the beauty of life.
The sun set, and the ocean all watched.
